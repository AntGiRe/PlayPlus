# PlayPlus
An application programmed in Java using a DB, in which to keep a count of the series and movies seen. As well as give them a rating

It is still in development and I am updating it as soon as I have available. Currently I have to refactor code. What I have done is produced in an afternoon without thinking much about the structure. So it is still necessary to give it a spin

- Bug fixes
- Refactor code and folder structure
- Smart search
- Add seasons in TV Shows
- Add genres in Movies
- More customization in the profile

At the moment as noteworthy things:
- Passwords are encrypted and stored in the BD
- Any user can add series and movies
- It has an intuitive interface, in my opinion
- And the colors are cool :D
